Hello,
We have read the topic of the project and we have figured out three main changes in the code:

- Task one   : changes in the greeks calculation, in the method 'calculate()' of the file binomialengine.hpp 
- Task two   : changes in the tree structure, in the file binomialtree.hpp and the main.cpp
- Task three : changes in the main.cpp in order to verify the performance of the changes by timing the code before and after
 
We have worked on the binomialengine.hpp trying to modify the function calculate. 
It does not compile yet because we have not reached to modify the tree structure to be correspondant to the chages we did.

We would want you to check if the way we are focusing this problem is likely correct. 

Sincerely,

Juan ROCHA
